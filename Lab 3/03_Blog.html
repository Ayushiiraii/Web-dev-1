                <h2>Exploring the Mountains</h2>
                <p>Last month I visited Himalayas,and it was one of the most peaceful experience of my life.
                    The fresh air, snowy peaks,and beautiful sunrises made me realize how close we are to nature when
                    we disconnect from technology.Traveling teaches us more than books sometimes!

                <p>Technology is moving faster than ever.Artificial Intelligence is not just part of research labs,it's
                    our
                    homes,phones, and even our cars.From self-driving vehicals to smart assistants,
                    the future is becoming more automated.But with this comes responsibility to use it wisely.

                    are small steps that lead to a happier lifestyle.
